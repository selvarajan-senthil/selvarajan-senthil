Hi, My name is Senthil Kumar Selvarajan. I am interested in developing a Cloud Manager APIs that could be used for realizing ETSI NFV-MANO, VNFM & VIM TOSCA profile template specified cloud-native workloads deployments.  
Also, I am learning 5G Core NW Architecture Components, to come up with approach for containerizing these NFs.
I am accessible @selvarajan-senthil.
